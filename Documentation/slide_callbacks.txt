Engine Documentaion Ideas

- how to write objects in the age .py file directly
- how to write xml directly
- how to use the age editor

Right now, I figure the most important is how to write with xml

slide.callbacks
slide.callbacks is a dictionary of callback functions. If set, they are called by the engine at particular times. They are not set by the engine, so they are available to the game developer.
'entry'         called when a slide is being entered
'exit'          called when a slide is being exited

The callback can be set in one of a few different ways:

in xml:

<slide id="dni1">
    <file>dnichamber1.jpg</file>
    <hotspot cursor="left">
        <rect>0,0,100,500</rect>
        <dest>dni3</dest>
    </hotspot>
    ...
   <onentry>somefunc</onentry>
</slide>

or in Dni.py:

def init(self):
    ...
    dni1 = self._slides["dni1"]
    dni1.callbacks['entry'] = self.somefunc

Both of these methods have the same result. The function should be defined as follows:

class Dni(Age):
    ...
    def somefunc(self, slide):
	    pass

'self' will obviously be the Dni age object, and slide will be the slide on which the callback was attatched. In this case, slide is the same as dni1 above.
